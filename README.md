# SQL for Data Engineering and Analytics with DuckDB
This repository documents my learning journey as a Data Engineering student exploring how SQL is used in real analytics pipelines with DuckDB. DuckDB is a fast, file-based database engine that makes it easy to run analytical queries directly on local data.
This work is part of the SQL for Data Analytics module from the **AIgineer lecture series**, where I’ve been applying database concepts through hands-on exercises and projects.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
I focus on improving my SQL skills, including querying, filtering, joins, aggregations, and CTEs. I also practiced setting up and managing a local analytical environment using the DuckDB CLI and UI. Along the way, I connected DuckDB with Python to experiment with data transformations and automation.
Another part of this project was learning how to organize my work with Git and GitHub while understanding how lightweight databases fit into a modern ETL and analytics workflow.

🧩 Tech Stack
- DuckDB for local analytics
- Python for scripting and analysis
- Bash and Git Bash for command-line work
- Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration

🧠 Purpose
This project is part of my ongoing effort to build a strong foundation in data engineering. It’s not just about writing SQL queries—it’s about learning how the tools connect and how data moves from raw files to meaningful insights.
