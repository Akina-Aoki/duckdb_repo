## 1. More extensive EDA on the sakila database

You will be using the same database as in 11_joins. Take some time to really understand this database, as we'll come back to this database later in this course and in data modeling course.

### a) Describe all tables.

### b) Select all data on all tables.

### c) Find out how many rows there are in each table.

The questions here might come from a business stakeholder which is not familiar with the table structure. Hence it's your job to find out which table(s) to look at.

### d) Calculate descriptive statistics on film length.

### e) What are the peak rental times?

### f) What is the distribution of film ratings?

### g) Who are the top 10 customers by number of rentals?

### h) Retrieve a list of all customers and what films they have rented.

### i) Make a more extensive EDA of your choice on the Sakila database.

## 2. Sets and joins on sakila

&nbsp; a) Retrieve a list of all customers and actors which last name starts with G.

&nbsp; e) Retrieve a list of all customers and what films they have rented.

&nbsp; f) What else cool information can you find out with this database using what you know about SQL.

## 3. Theory questions

These study questions are good to get an overview of how SQL and relational databases work.

&nbsp; a) What is the difference between INNER JOIN and INTERSECT?

&nbsp; b) When are the purposes of set operations?

&nbsp; c) What are the main difference between joins and set operations?

&nbsp; d) When is set operators used contra logical operators?

&nbsp; e) How to achieve this using set operations in SQL, where A and B are result sets.
