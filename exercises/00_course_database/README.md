# Glossary
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| CRUD | Create, Read, Update, Delete — the four fundamental operations on data in a database. |
| Query | A request sent to a database to retrieve or compute data. |
| Statement | A single instruction executed by the database (e.g., SELECT, INSERT). |
| DDL (Data Definition Language) | Commands used to define or modify database structure (CREATE, DROP, ALTER). |
| DML (Data Manipulation Language) | Commands used to modify existing data inside tables (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). |
| DQL (Data Query Language) | Commands that retrieve data without modifying it (SELECT). |
| Idempotent | An operation that has the same result even if executed multiple times (e.g., SELECT). |
| Table | A structure containing rows and columns where data is stored. |
| Schema | A container that organizes tables and defines database structure. |
| Row | A single record in a table. |
| Record | Another term for a row; one complete entry of data. |
| Column | A vertical set of values of the same data type in a table. |
| Database | A structured collection of persistent data stored digitally. |
| Persistence | Data that remains stored even after an application stops. |
| Relational Database | A database that stores data in related tables using keys. |
| Dot Commands | Commands in DuckDB’s CLI used to navigate or inspect (.schema, .tables, .mode). |
| CLI (Command Line Interface) | Text-based interface where you type commands to interact with software. |
| Bash | A Unix shell and command language used to run terminal commands. |
| Type Inference | DuckDB’s ability to automatically detect column data types from input files. |
| Clause | A component of a SQL statement (WHERE, FROM, GROUP BY, HAVING). |
| Aliasing | Giving a temporary name to a table or column using AS. |
| SQL Statement | Any valid instruction in SQL (SELECT, CREATE, INSERT, etc.). |
| Persistent Database | A database saved on disk that remains after closing the tool. |
| .wal (Write-Ahead Log) | A file DuckDB uses to track changes before writing them to the main database. |
| IDE (Integrated Development Environment) | A tool combining editors, debuggers, and DB tools (e.g., DBeaver). |
| CSV | Comma-Separated Values — a plain text format for storing tabular data. |
| Namespace | A logical container grouping objects to avoid naming conflicts (similar to schemas). |
| SQL Engine | The component that parses, optimizes, and executes SQL queries. |
| Primary Key | A column or set of columns that uniquely identifies a row. |
| Foreign Key | A column linking one table to another, establishing relationships. |
| Constraint | A rule applied to a column or table (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK). |
| ETL | Extract, Transform, Load — a pipeline for moving and processing data. |
| OLAP | Online Analytical Processing — databases optimized for analytics (like DuckDB). |
| OLTP | Online Transaction Processing — databases optimized for many small transactions (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL). |
| In-Memory Processing | Computing done directly in RAM for speed — part of DuckDB’s performance advantage. |
| Columnar Storage | Data stored column-by-column; improves analytical query speed. |
